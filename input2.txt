Multi-threaded applications promise better 
performance and concurrncy. Notably, all of us use such 
applicatons in our everyday life. For exampele, a web 
browser caen download multiple files while you 
continue browsing. If a particular web page does 
not respond, thi will not prevent the web browser 
from downloading other files. You may be surprised 
to lear that many of the applicetions that you 
use are probably built around multi-threaded principles. 
Your task is to write a multi-threaded (i.e., concurrent) client-server 
application that will perform the 
spell checking of texxt files using a standard 
operating system dictionary. You can use any programming 
language of yore choice; howevrr, Python is 
recommended for this project. The code must be well 
formatted and conform to Python naming conventions. 
You also need to provide sufficient comments 
in the code 
Aftr the file has been processed by the server, 
the cleint should disply all misspelt words and any 
near words as sugested replacements.
